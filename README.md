> **NOTICE** This package is no longer maintained.  It will stop working when the Manifest v2 changes are enforced.  I will not be transferring ownership of the package to anyone for security reasons, but feel free to fork and start your own.

**UPDATE**: Google support has been removed, as their tracking no longer occurs via a redirection.  See [this issue](https://github.com/xwipeoutx/undirect/issues/13) for more information.

When searching using google, the result links don't go directly to the site - they first send the user to an interim "redirecting" page, which they use to keep track of user's search results

Usually, this isn't a problem, but sometimes when you're on a slow connection, or want to send friends a link straight from the search results, this just gets in the way.

Undirect is a simple chrome extension that removes this tracking and redirection from google search results.

Works for all google domains across all countries, and is very light-weight.
